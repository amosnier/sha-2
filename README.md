# sha-2 ![Build passing](svg/passing.svg)

## Contents

SHA-2 algorithm implementations.

At the moment, only SHA-256 is implemented.

## Design criteria

- C99

- Easy to test, include in any project, compile and link.

- Portable. Makes no assumptions on the target system's endianess or
  word size.

## Streaming API

In response to [an enhancement
request](https://github.com/amosnier/sha-2/issues/9), a new streaming
API has been created.

The following code is a silly but complete example:

```C
struct Sha_256 sha_256;
uint8_t hash[32];
sha_256_init(&sha_256, hash);
sha_256_write(&sha_256, "ab", strlen("ab"));
sha_256_write(&sha_256, "c", strlen("c"));
sha_256_close(&sha_256);
```

That is the equivalent of the (of course still supported) legacy way:

```C
uint8_t hash[32];
calc_sha_256(hash, "abc", strlen("abc"));
```

See [header file](https://github.com/amosnier/sha-2/blob/master/sha-256.h)
for more information.

Since the streaming API is a generalization of the non-streaming one,
the latter has been ported to the former, without measurable performance
impact. However, [a legacy
branch](https://github.com/amosnier/sha-2/tree/legacy) has been created
in order to make the legacy implementation easily available. If you can
measure a significant difference between the two, please post an issue.

## Notes

The Makefile is as minimal as possible. No effort was put into making
it general. Its purpose is mainly to ease testing for the developer's
host machine. The actual implementation is however extremely easy to
include in any project, may it use GNU make or any other build tool.

## Testing

The implementation has been successfully tested on an x86-64 machine
under Linux as well as on a 16-bit DSP. On the x86-64 machine, all the
available NIST test vectors where successfully tested ([SHA-256
examples](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Standards-and-Guidelines/documents/examples/SHA256.pdf)
and [SHA-2 Additional
examples](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Standards-and-Guidelines/documents/examples/SHA2_Additional.pdf),
plus a few others).

## Reference implementation

I had missed that when I made this implementation but [RFC 6234, chapter 8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234#section-8) actually includes a reference implementation in C that is (at least in ambition) broader in scope than this one. I have however neither compiled nor tested it.
